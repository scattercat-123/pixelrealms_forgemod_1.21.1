# PixelRealms README

Yo! Welcome to **PixelRealms** – a tech mod that's all about **Light Orbs** and good vibes. If you're into **Optifine** and **JEI**, you’re gonna love this one. It’s got a bit of everything, from fancy blocks to power-up items, and it all runs smoother than your last Minecraft server.

## What's the Deal?
PixelRealms is packed with **Light Orbs** that will light up your world (literally). But that’s just the start! We've also got **Exclusive Solar Panels** that send redstone signals when the sun’s shining bright. Oh, and check out the **Chiseled Stairs** — they're like regular stairs, but way more elegant and detailed (seriously, no comparison).

## 1.21.1? Nah...
This mod was started for 1.21.1 but, guess what? It’s not playin' nice with it. So, I’m stoppin' that version halfway. Don't worry, though — I’ll drop a 1.20.1 version soon! It's gonna be **fire** and work like a charm.
